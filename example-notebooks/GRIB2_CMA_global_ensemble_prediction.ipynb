    "# GRIB2-CMA GEPS\n",
    "This notebook provides an example on how to decode GRIB2 data using the pygrib library. In this example, we will read the Global Ensemble Prediction System of China Meteorological Administration (CMA-GEPS) and display one of the parameters on maps.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The following references were used to create this notebook:<br>\n",
    "- Sample data from <https://wis2node.wis.cma.cn/oapi/collections/discovery-metadata/items/urn:wmo:md:cn-cma:data.core.weather.prediction.forecast.medium-range.probabilistic.global>\n",
    "- Python code to load GRIB data, see <https://pypi.org/project/pygrib/><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample data is included in the base-image of [demo-decode-eccodes-jupyter](https://github.com/wmo-im/demo-decode-eccodes-jupyter).<br>\n",

    "__Data Description__<br>\n",
    "The Global Ensemble Prediction System of China Meteorological Administration (CMA-GEPS) carries out physics calculations to arrive at probabilistic predictions of atmospheric elements from the current day out to 15 days. The CMA-GEPS produces different forecasts to estimate the forecast uncertainties due to the nonlinear (chaotic) nature of the atmosphere. The probabilistic predictions are based on an ensemble of 30 perturbed members that differ in their initial conditions with Singular Vectors (SVs), their model uncertainties which are randomly perturbed by Stochastic Physics Perturbation Tendency (SPPT) method, and the Stochastic Kinetic Energy Backscatter (SKEB). A control member that is not perturbed is also available. <br>\n",
    "Weather elements include temperature, precipitation, wind speed, gust and others. <br>\n",
    "This product contains raw numerical results of these members. <br>\n",
    "Geographical coverage is global. Data is available on a global latitude-longitude uniform grid with 0.5 degree horizontal resolution. <br>\n",
    "Predictions are performed twice a day and initial conditions are at 00 UTC and 12 UTC.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "This notebook uses several Python modules for reading GRIB data, numerical computing, visualization, and cartographic mapping:  \n",
    "\n",
    "The following modules are imported:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **pygrib**: Python interface for reading and writing GRIB (Gridded Binary) files, enabling extraction of meteorological data (e.g., loading forecast fields like temperature or wind).  \n",
    "- **numpy**: Numerical Python library for efficient array operations and mathematical computations (e.g., `np.array` for handling gridded data).  \n",
    "- **matplotlib**: Plotting library for creating static, interactive, or animated visualizations (e.g., `plt` for rendering maps or graphs).  \n",
    "- **cartopy**: Cartographic library for geospatial data visualization, offering map projections and geographic features (e.g., `ccrs` for coordinate reference systems, `cfeature` for adding coastlines or borders).  \n",
    "\n",
    "This setup is typically used for analyzing and visualizing meteorological or climate data stored in GRIB format, with **pygrib** handling data ingestion and the remaining modules supporting processing and mapping tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About **pygrib**  \n",
    "**Python library for reading GRIB files (editions 1 and 2)**, enabling access to meteorological and climate data stored in GRIB format. Requires the **ECCODES C library** as a dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you are running the Jupyter environment provided by 'demo-decode-eccodes-jupyter', pygrib is already installed.** If you are running a local Jupyter environment, please follow the instructions below to install pygrib.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing pygrib on a local Jupyter environment\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Recommended Installation (Conda)**  \n",
    "For Anaconda/Miniconda users, the simplest method is:  \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge pygrib\n",
    "```  \n",
    "This automatically resolves dependencies (e.g., ECCODES, numpy, pyproj).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Verification**  \n",
    "Test installation with:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pygrib\n",
    "print(pygrib.__version__)  # Should output the installed version (e.g., `2.1.6`)\n",
    "```  "

    "The first code block import pygrib and displays the versions of pygrib and eccodes to verify the installation. It also sets the path to the GRIB2 file to be read. By default, it uses a sample GRIB2 file included in the Docker image. If you are running this notebook on your local machine, please change the path to point to your downloaded GRIB2 file.\n",
